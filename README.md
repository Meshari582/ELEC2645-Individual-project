The application is a menu-driven electrical engineering calculator written in C.
It is designed to safely perform calculations only with valid inputs while rejecting invalid user input and preventing undefined artihmatic operations. 

The application is split into two main source files
main.c controls the main program and user inputs.
funcs.c contains the numerical calculations and input validation functions.

The calculator has the following functions: 

1: Voltage divider-solves for Vout, Vin, R1 or R2 

2: Resistor tools- calculates equivilent resistence in series and parallel (2 resistors)

3: AC reactance and resonance- solves for inductive reactance, capacitive reactance and resonant frequency.

4:RC transients-time constant, charge/discharge percentages and inverse calculations.

5: Power equations- Solve for power, voltage or current.
